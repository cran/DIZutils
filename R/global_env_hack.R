#' @title global_env_hack
#' @description Hack variable into global env (bypasses R CMD checks).
#'   This does create a new variable in the R environment but NOT a new
#'   variable in the system environment. To create a system environment
#'   variable beeing accessible via `Sys.getenv(...)`, use the function
#'   `DIZutils::setenv2(key = "varname", val = 7)`.
#'
#' @inheritParams DIZtools::assign_to_R_env
#'
#' @seealso \url{http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Environments.html}
#' @return No return value, called for side effects (see description).
#' @examples
#' utils_path <- tempdir()
#' global_env_hack(
#'   key = "utils_path",
#'   val = utils_path,
#'   pos = 1L
#' )
